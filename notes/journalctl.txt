Journalctl is a very nice way of accessing specific logs

You can view all the logs by running: sudo journalctl

You can get the logs of a prticular service by: sudo journalctl -u <service>
						e.g. journalctl -u vnc.service

You can fetch the logs by date: sudo journalctl --since "2017-12-10 19:00:00"

You can use a time range: sudo journalctl --since "2017-12-10" --until "2016-1-1"

You can also be pretty blunt about it: sudo journalctl --since yesterday

In some cases you might want to be more specific like: journalctl --since "2017-12-10" --until "4 hours ago"

You can use to specify a service's log: sudo journalctl -u vnc.service --since "2017-12-05 16:17:47" --until "2017-12-12 15:03:02"


You can also fetch logs from two services using the same command:

	sudo journalctl -u vnc.service -u pentaho.service

And if you want to be really techie, you add time into the mix: 
	sudo journalctl -u vnc.service -u pentaho.service --since "2 days ago"


It does not end here :-)
You can get user logs pretty easily
First, get your user ID by running: 'id <user>'  e.g. id kanataki
Then run: sudo journalctl _UID=<userid>

Of course now you know you can add some time thingy :-):
		Then run: sudo journalctl _UID=<userid> --since "2 days ago"


We can also view our logs according to boot sessions:

Since last boot: sudo journalctl -b
