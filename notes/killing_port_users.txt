In some cases you might want to free a port that is in use.

First you have to find out what proceses are using that port.
Do this by running: lsof -ti:<port>
		e.g. lsof -ti:5901

then run: lsof -ti:5901 | xargs kill -9 to kill whatever that is using that port.

If you want a detailed report on what is using the port, run: netstat -tulpn | grep <port>

You can also use ss like: ss -ltp | grep <port>
