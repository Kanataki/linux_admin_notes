I use LVM to create and manage logical volumes in Linux.

I break it into the following:
Creating Partitions:
Creating Physical volumes:
creating Volume groups:
creating logical volumes:
Extending volumes:
	lvextend -L+3G /dev/centos/var
	substitute /dev/centos/var with the path to the particular logical volume.
The volume will have extended but now you have to extend the file system.
If on centOS, use:
		xfs_growfs /dev/centos/var
		substitute /dev/centos/var with the path to the particular logical volume.

on other Linux distros, you can use:
				resize2fs /dev/centos/var
				substitute /dev/centos/var with the path to the particular logical volume.
