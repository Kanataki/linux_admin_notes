                                [AUTO START PENTAHO BI ON BOOT]
=====================================================================================================================
This is the process I used to write a service to auto start Pentaho BI-server on boot.

Pre-requisite: knowledge of how systemd works will be useful here.

The plan is to create a service in [/usr/lib/systemd/system/] which will look like: $vi /usr/lib/systemd/system/pentaho.service

I then have to include the system unit script in the above created service which will be like this:

				[Unit]
				Description=Pentho Bi-server
				After=syslog.target
				After=network.target

				[Service]
				Type=forking
				User=[user]
				Group=[group]
				Environment=JAVA_HOME=/usr/java/latest
				ExecStart=/opt/Pentaho/pentaho-server/start-pentaho.sh
				ExecStartPost=/bin/echo pentaho...end of unitfile


				TimeoutSec=300

				[Install]
				WantedBy=graphical.target


Remember to substitute the BI-server paths with the ones you are actually using.

Enable the service by running systemctl enable pentaho.service

You can now test your service by running systemctl status pentaho.service

Lastly tail catalina log to check whether your service is working: $tail -f /opt/Pentaho/pentaho-server/tomcat/logs/catalina.out

NB:the paths depend on where you did your installation.

if you run into the following error:

		‚óè pentaho.service - Pentho Bi-server
   		Loaded: loaded (/usr/lib/systemd/system/pentaho.service; enabled; vendor preset: disabled)
  		Active: inactive (dead)

There are a couple of things you can try. However, I advise cross checking whether your script is okay before changing anything.

	option1: Run 'systemctl start pentaho.service' and pay attention to the errors you'll receive.
	option2: Now, here's where you change a few things,
		check your Type under [service], it should be 'Type=forking'.
		If however you're still getting the errors, change the type to 'Type=oneshot'.

After making any kind of change, reload the systemd service by running: systemctl daemon-reload
Then run:
	$systemctl start pentaho.service
	 and $systemctl status pentaho.service respectively.

Have fun doing magic :-)
