Well Hello there,

Some hacker bugger disturbing you again heh!

No worries, this is easy peasy!

I assume you have ssh server set up already.
Go to your ssh client and create the keys.

	ssh-keygen -t rsa

set permissions for your private key:

	chmod 700 ~/.ssh
	chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_rsa

Copy the public key to the server and install it to the authorized_keys list.

	cat id_rsa.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys

change the permissions to the public key:

	chmod 700 ~/.ssh
	chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys

If you are still running SELinux,make sure all the correct contexts are set by running:

	restorecon -Rv ~/.ssh
