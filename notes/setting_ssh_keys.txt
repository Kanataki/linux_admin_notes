Well Hello there,

Some hacker bugger disturbing you again heh!

No worries, this is easy peasy!

I assume you have ssh server set up already.
Go to your ssh client and create the keys.

	ssh-keygen -t rsa

You can ignore the '-t rsa' part if you like.

set permissions for your private key:

	chmod 700 ~/.ssh
	chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_rsa

You can ignore the permissions if you want. However, if you get errors go back and implement them.

Copy the public key from the client by issuing the folowing command:

cat id_rsa.pub 

copy the contents of the file.

ssh into the server and edit the authorized keys file:

sudo vi ~/.ssh/authorized_keys

if there are other existing keys, hit a new line and add yours.

Save the file and exit

if you want,you can change the permissions:

	chmod 700 ~/.ssh
	chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys

If you are still running SELinux,make sure all the correct contexts are set by running:

	restorecon -Rv ~/.ssh

Got to the ssh config file and turn off password login:

		go to sudo /etc/ssh/sshd_config

		and set 'PasswordAuthentication'to 'no'


Restart the ssh server:

	sudo systemctl restart sshd.service

Happy security :-)
