This can confuse you at first but at times you might want to SSH into into an EC2 instance from another EC2 instance.

If both instances are in the same subnet then this is easy. All you have to do is set up public and private keys.

 Here is how you do it:

	We are ssh-ing from server A to server B.
	
	server A: ssh-keygen

		  Hit enter enter enter. You'll have two files:

			.ssh/id_rsa
			.ssh/id_rsa.pub

		  cat and copy to clipboard the public key:

			cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
			[select and copy to your clipboard]

	server B: ssh-keygen
		

		cat >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
		[paste your clipboard contents]
		[ctrl+d to exit]



	Server A: ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa private.ip.of.other.server
