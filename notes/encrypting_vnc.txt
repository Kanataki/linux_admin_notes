VNC is pretty useful when connecting to remote servers since it is graphical in nature and lets you see pretty stuff :-)
However, VNC is not encrypted and thus not very safe to use especially with critical servers.
SSH on the other hand is very secure but it just text-based and has no pretty stuff :-(
but worry not, past me has got you sorted :-)

You can actually tunnel VNC on SSH thereby getting the pretty GUI and the secure connection all in one. 

How to do this?

On your client machine connect to your remote server by running:

	ssh -l 5900:<ip>:5900 <ip>
	e.g. ssh -l 5900:192.168.1.90:5900 192.168.1.90

The -l sets up a tunnel from your client machine to the remote server.

Now you can connect again to the server using VNC and your connection will be encrypted. :-)


NB: if your OS doesn't allow you to connect via VNC, try to use a diferent port number for your client machine.
e.g. ssh -l 5999:192.168.1.90:5900 192.168.1.90

Now try to connect via VNC.

cheers!
