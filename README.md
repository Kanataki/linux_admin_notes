# linux_admin_notes
##My life is an episode of having to redo a lot of things, most of them on my Centos machines.
##I am a very lazy person and hate having to remember every little thing that I do.
##Therefore, some of the notes end up here.
##This are simple directions (will CLI commands) on how to do most basic stuff on Linux.
##I don't always manage to write them down but I try to.
##Of course there are very many ways to do things and my ways won't always be the fastest/simplest/safest.
##You are welcome to fork/star :-)
